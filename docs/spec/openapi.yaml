        Create the structure of an evaluation that can be used to test a model's performance.
        An evaluation is a set of testing criteria and a datasource. After creating an evaluation, you can run it on different models and model parameters. We support several types of graders and datasources.
        For more information, see the [Evals guide](/docs/guides/evals).

        Upload a file that can be used across various endpoints. Individual files can be up to 512 MB, and the size of all files uploaded by one organization can be up to 100 GB.

        The Assistants API supports files up to 2 million tokens and of specific file types. See the [Assistants Tools guide](/docs/assistants/tools) for details.

        The Fine-tuning API only supports `.jsonl` files. The input also has certain required formats for fine-tuning [chat](/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/chat-input) or [completions](/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/completions-input) models.

        The Batch API only supports `.jsonl` files up to 200 MB in size. The input also has a specific required [format](/docs/api-reference/batch/request-input).

        Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more in the [Structured Outputs guide](/docs/guides/structured-outputs).

        Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON.

        **Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length

        Configuration for turn detection, ether Server VAD or Semantic VAD. This can be set to `null` to turn off, in which case the client must manually trigger model response.
        Server VAD means that the model will detect the start and end of speech based on audio volume and respond at the end of user speech.
        Semantic VAD is more advanced and uses a turn detection model (in conjuction with VAD) to semantically estimate whether the user has finished speaking, then dynamically sets a timeout based on this probability. For example, if user audio trails off with "uhhm", the model will score a low probability of turn end and wait longer for the user to continue speaking. This can be useful for more natural conversations, but may have a higher latency

You can use this [tokenizer tool](/tokenizer?view=bpe) to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

    AssistantStreamEvent:
      description: |
        Represents an event emitted when streaming a Run.

        Each event in a server-sent events stream has an `event` and `data` property:

        ```
        event: thread.created
        data: {"id": "thread_123", "object": "thread", ...}
        ```

        We emit events whenever a new object is created, transitions to a new state, or is being
        streamed in parts (deltas). For example, we emit `thread.run.created` when a new run
        is created, `thread.run.completed` when a run completes, and so on. When an Assistant chooses
        to create a message during a run, we emit a `thread.message.created event`, a
        `thread.message.in_progress` event, many `thread.message.delta` events, and finally a
        `thread.message.completed` event.

        We may add additional events over time, so we recommend handling unknown events gracefully
        in your code. See the [Assistants API quickstart](/docs/assistants/overview) to learn how to
        integrate the Assistants API with streaming

            The ID of an uploaded file that contains training data.

            See [upload file](/docs/api-reference/files/create) for how to upload a file.

            Your dataset must be formatted as a JSONL file. Additionally, you must upload your file with the purpose `fine-tune`.

            The contents of the file should differ depending on if the model uses the [chat](/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/chat-input), [completions](/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/completions-input) format, or if the fine-tuning method uses the [preference](/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/preference-input) format.

            See the [fine-tuning guide](/docs/guides/fine-tuning) for more details

            the fine-tuning results file.
            The same data should not be present in both train and validation files.

        Configuration for turn detection, ether Server VAD or Semantic VAD. This can be set to `null` to turn off, in which case the client must manually trigger model response.
        Server VAD means that the model will detect the start and end of speech based on audio volume and respond at the end of user speech.
        Semantic VAD is more advanced and uses a turn detection model (in conjuction with VAD) to semantically estimate whether the user has finished speaking, then dynamically sets a timeout based on this probability. For example, if user audio trails off with "uhhm", the model will score a low probability of turn end and wait longer for the user to continue speaking. This can be useful for more natural conversations, but may have a higher latency

      OpenAI's most advanced interface for generating model responses. Supports
      text and image inputs, and text outputs. Create stateful interactions
      with the model, using the output of previous responses as input. Extend
      the model's capabilities with built-in tools for file search, web search,
      computer use, and more. Allow the model access to external systems and data
      using function calling.

      The Audit Logs endpoint provides a log of all actions taken in the organization for security and monitoring purposes.
      To access these endpoints please generate an Admin API Key through the [API Platform Organization overview](/organization/admin-keys). Admin API keys cannot be used for non-administration endpoints.

    title: Admin API Keys
    description: |
      Admin API keys enable Organization Owners to programmatically manage various aspects of their organization, including users, projects, and API keys. These keys provide administrative capabilities, such as creating, updating, and deleting users; managing projects; and overseeing API key lifecycles.

      Key Features of Admin API Keys:

      - User Management: Invite new users, update roles, and remove users from the organization.

      - Project Management: Create, update, archive projects, and manage user assignments within projects.

      - API Key Oversight: List, retrieve, and delete API keys associated with projects.

      Only Organization Owners have the authority to create and utilize Admin API keys. To manage these keys, Organization Owners can navigate to the Admin Keys section of their API Platform dashboard.

      For direct access to the Admin Keys management page, Organization Owners can use the following link:

      [https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/admin-keys](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/admin-keys)

      It's crucial to handle Admin API keys with care due to their elevated permissions. Adhering to best practices, such as regular key rotation and assigning appropriate permissions, enhances security and ensures proper governance within the organization.

      The **Usage API** provides detailed insights into your activity across the OpenAI API. It also includes a separate [Costs endpoint](/docs/api-reference/usage/costs), which offers visibility into your spend, breaking down consumption by invoice line items and project IDs.

      While the Usage API delivers granular usage data, it may not always reconcile perfectly with the Costs due to minor differences in how usage and spend are recorded. For financial purposes, we recommend using the [Costs endpoint](/docs/api-reference/usage/costs) or the [Costs tab](/settings/organization/usage) in the Usage Dashboard, which will reconcile back to your billing invoice.
